### Hi there 👋

My name is Berk. 

:mortar_board: I have graduated from the Faculty of Law and after I have worked 4 years as a Lawyer :balance_scale:

:video_game: I was a gamer entire my life. Then I learned C# language and Unity Game Engine. Then I decided to be a game developer to make games I have dreamed of. 

It's like pressing the "New Game" button in real life!

On this road to being Game Dev, I completed several online courses and Certificated programs to improve myself. And I am still taking new courses and making practice. The following are the most important Certificates for me;

1- Unity Junior Programmer (Completed May 2022) [![Certificate Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-certificate-success)](https://www.credly.com/badges/8bf0b499-493a-43e2-944b-14ab761f00d8?source=linked_in_profile)

2- Patika.dev Unity Learn Path (Completed May 2022) [![Certificate Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-certificate-success)](https://app.patika.dev/certificates/PzpRQf3)

Then I have been selected for Patika.dev & Google Casual Game Development Bootcamp (June- August 2022). I am still continuing to Bootcamp. 

You can find some of my projects and some of my prototypes at my repos.
