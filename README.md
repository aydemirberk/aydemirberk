### Hi there 👋

My name is Berk. 

:mortar_board: I have graduated from the Faculty of Law and after that I have worked 4 years as a Lawyer :balance_scale:

:video_game: I was a gamer entire my life. Then I learned C# language and Unity Game Engine. Then I decided to be a game developer to make games I have dreamed of. 

It's like pressing the "New Game" button in real life!

On this road to being Game Dev, I completed several online courses and Certificated programs to improve myself.Then I have graduated from Patika.dev & Google Casual Game Development Bootcamp (June- August 2022).
